                  The term silog is a portmanteau of sinangag (fried rice) and <br> itlog (egg). 
                  A silog meal, therefore, has at least these two elements present. <br> The third component is a type of meat – tapa being one of them.
                  In the Philippines, <br> tapa refers to dried cured beef. It’s soft and chewy, mostly savory and mildly sweet. 
                  <br> Together, this trifecta constitutes the most iconic and beloved Filipino breakfast – the tapsilog.

                  Scrambled Eggs are perfect for breakfast. They’re soft and creamy, <br>

                  Making scrambled eggs isn’t complicated. 
                  A bit of salt and pepper for flavour, <br> a little butter to cook, and fresh eggs is 
                  all you need for a perfect breakfast.
